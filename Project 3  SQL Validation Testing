# Project 3 – SQL Data Validation

## Description
This project focuses on validating data integrity in the database using SQL queries.  
The database contains at least two tables: `users` and `payments`.  
The goal is to detect invalid data, negative amounts, and inconsistent relations.

## Tables (Conceptual)
- `users(id, name, email, created_at, ...)`  
- `payments(id, user_id, amount, date, ...)`

## Validation Queries (Examples)
The queries used in this project are stored in `queries.sql`.

### Checks Performed
1. Invalid email formats in `users` table  
2. Negative payment amounts in `payments` table  
3. Users without any payments (potential business edge cases)

## Example Findings
- 0 users with invalid email format.  
- 1 payment with a negative amount (requires correction).  
- 3 users without any payments – may be valid depending on business logic, but documented as part of the analysis.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability to:
- Write SQL queries for validation  
- Identify anomalies in production-like data  
- Support QA and product decisions using database-level checks
